# Dynamic Movie Booking Insights Platform

## Overview

The Dynamic Movie Booking Insights Platform is a robust solution designed to process real-time movie ticket booking data and provide actionable insights. By leveraging Snowflakeâ€™s Dynamic Tables, Streams, Tasks, and integrated Streamlit, the platform delivers a seamless analytics experience. The interactive dashboard allows businesses to track revenue, ticket sales, and booking trends with ease.

## Features

1)	Real-Time Data Processing:

    â€¢	Tracks changes in booking data using Snowflake Streams and Tasks.

    â€¢	Handles CDC (Change Data Capture) events like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

2)	Dynamic Insights:

    â€¢	Aggregates data in real-time using Snowflakeâ€™s Dynamic Tables.

    â€¢	Provides metrics such as revenue, tickets sold, cancellations, and more.

3) Integrated Streamlit Dashboard:

    â€¢	Hosted directly in Snowflake for a zero-setup experience.
 
    â€¢	Offers filters for date range and booking status.

    â€¢	Visualizes data through tables, metrics, and charts.

## Technology Stack

### Snowflake

â€¢ Streams: For capturing changes in booking data.


â€¢ Tasks: To automate processing and aggregation of data.


â€¢ Dynamic Tables: To enable real-time analytics.


â€¢ Python Worksheets: For developing and running Python-based logic.


### Streamlit (Built into Snowflake)

	
â€¢ For creating the interactive and responsive dashboard.

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Set Up Database in Snowflake

1.	Log in to your Snowflake account.

2.	Create a new worksheet.

3.	Copy the content of the snowflake_dynamic_tables.sql file into the worksheet and execute it.
	
     â€¢	This script creates:
	
     â€¢	The database movies and required tables.
	
     â€¢	Streams and tasks for processing CDC events.
	
     â€¢	Dynamic tables for analytics.

4.	Activate the tasks:

``` ALTER TASK ingest_cdc_events_task RESUME; ```


``` ALTER TASK refresh_movie_booking_insights RESUME; ```

### Step 2: Launch the Streamlit Dashboard
	
 1.	Open a Python Worksheet in Snowflake.
	
 2.	Copy the contents of the streamlit_app.py file into the worksheet.
	
 3.	Click the Run button in the worksheet to ensure no errors occur.
	
 4.	Click the Streamlit button (usually located in the top-right corner of the worksheet) to launch the interactive dashboard.

## Using the Dashboard

### Filters
	
 â€¢ Date Range: Filter booking data by selecting a specific date range.
	
 â€¢ Booking Status: Filter bookings by status (BOOKED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED, or all).

### Insights

#### Metrics:

   â€¢ Total Bookings
 
   â€¢ Total Tickets Sold
 
   â€¢ Total Revenue
 
#### Charts:
  
   â€¢ Revenue by Booking Status
 
   â€¢ Tickets Sold by Status
 
   â€¢ Bookings and Revenue by Movie
 
#### Tables:

   â€¢ Detailed revenue and booking data by movie or status.

How It Works
	1.	Data Ingestion:
	â€¢	Booking data is inserted, updated, or deleted in the raw_movie_bookings table.
	â€¢	The movie_bookings_stream captures CDC events (insert, update, delete).
	2.	Data Processing:
	â€¢	The task ingest_cdc_events_task processes CDC events and stores them in movie_booking_cdc_events.
	â€¢	Dynamic tables (movie_bookings_filtered and movie_booking_insights) aggregate and filter the data for analysis.
	3.	Visualization:
	â€¢	The Streamlit app fetches data directly from Snowflake tables and visualizes it dynamically.

 Key SQL and Python Components
	1.	Snowflake SQL Components:
	â€¢	Streams: movie_bookings_stream to track CDC changes.
	â€¢	Tasks: ingest_cdc_events_task and refresh_movie_booking_insights for data processing and refreshing.
	â€¢	Dynamic Tables:
	â€¢	movie_bookings_filtered: Filters relevant booking data.
	â€¢	movie_booking_insights: Aggregates key metrics and insights.
	2.	Streamlit Dashboard:
	â€¢	Filters data based on user input (date range and status).
	â€¢	Displays metrics, charts, and tables for easy analysis.


 Future Enhancements
	â€¢	Predictive Analytics:
	â€¢	Use machine learning models for demand forecasting and revenue prediction.
	â€¢	User Management:
	â€¢	Add authentication and role-based access control.
	â€¢	Custom Notifications:
	â€¢	Notify users about booking trends or anomalies.
	â€¢	Data Export:
	â€¢	Provide an option to export data as CSV or Excel.
